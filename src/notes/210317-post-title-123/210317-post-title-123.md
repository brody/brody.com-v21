Over on the Sentry blog I wrote about [how we shipped dark mode](#) what we did, what we struggled with, and ultimately why this was such a great project for our team and our design system:

<!-- > For most front-end codebases, the design of your color system shows you where your radioactive styles are. It shows you how things are tied together, and what depends on what. Sure, we wanted dark mode to look great. But we also wanted to make sure that dark mode doesn’t slow us down by introducing even more problems than we already have.

> And I think that’s what our team achieved here. We made our designs more consistent, buried those radioactive styles, made relationships between colors, and hopefully slightly improved the way we build front-end components moving forward. -->

1% better every day.
